description: At the Polster Lab, we use systems medicine approaches to understand complex diseases and advance precision healthcare. Our research integrates multi-omics data (genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic) with computational modeling and machine learning to uncover the molecular mechanisms that drive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), as well as to explore strategies for promoting healthy aging.
