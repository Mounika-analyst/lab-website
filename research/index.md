**Neurodegenerative Disease Research**

We develop and apply network-based methods, including single-cell gene regulatory network analyses, to investigate how cellular regulation differs between healthy and diseased states. By examining patient- and cell-specific regulatory interactions, we aim to pinpoint how changes in DNA repair, metabolic function, inflammatory pathways, and other core processes contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Our lab is also committed to leveraging explainable AI techniques to ensure that computational findings can be meaningfully interpreted in a biological and clinical context.


**Personalized and Translational Approaches**

Recognizing the heterogeneity of complex disorders, we focus on identifying novel subgroups or “endotypes” within patient populations. Through integrative statistical and bioinformatic approaches, we aim to discover biomarkers that can guide more individualized prevention and treatment strategies. By bridging basic science insights with clinical data, our goal is to translate network-level discoveries into actionable interventions for patients.


**Population-Level Strategies and Aging Research**

Beyond disease-specific work, our lab develops quantitative frameworks to measure and monitor overall health at the population level. We explore how novel ageing metrics can inform public health initiatives, guide targeted screening, and refine our understanding of healthy aging. By combining large-scale cohort data with advanced analytics, we seek to outline strategies that not only delay disease onset but also extend healthspan.
