Neurodegenerative Disease Research:

We develop and apply network-based methods, including single-cell gene regulatory network analyses, to investigate how cellular regulation differs between healthy and diseased states. By examining patient- and cell-specific regulatory interactions, we aim to pinpoint how changes in DNA repair, metabolic function, inflammatory pathways, and other core processes contribute to the onset and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. Our lab is also committed to leveraging explainable AI techniques to ensure that computational findings can be meaningfully interpreted in a biological and clinical context.
